# Crawler_Darkweb

In the modern world there were too many problems affecting the growth and health of the younger minds. Drugs become inevitable enemy that destorys the career
of the younger minds. There were too many paths focused on drug trafficking in india. As engineering graduates we put a little effort to stop the online drug
campaign that roams around the dark net!
Yes dark net was the untouched word while teaching. Our internet is divided into three parts. first the surface web. It holds the major share in the day to day
internet trafficking. It holds only 10% of the ocean mark in the total ocean. Deep web forms 95% of the net and includes data not indexed by search engines.
This means that you will not access this data with a simple search. So, the surface web can be tracked by search engines, while the deep net includes everything
that search engines cannot identify, because they are protected with a password or stored behind internet services. This is why spiders are invisible.
Actually, you spend a lot of time on deep pages, but you don’t even know it. The dark web (or so-called dark net) includes sites designed to be hidden which mostly
have The Onion Routerurls that are impossible to remember, guess or understand. TOR websites aren’t popular, and they are not accessible without using
secific software programs, as a great deal of data is encrypted and hosted mostly anonymously. TOR was the acronym for the The Onion Router.
We developed a crawler focused on the Tor network, which searches, analyses,
and indexes websites containing drug patterns. The general objective of the work is to
develop a search engine that allows the search of sites with illegal content within the TOR
network through crawlers dedicated to search, identify, and index secret services, black
markets, to improve the accuracy of results of current search engines.
It crawls the websites containing drug selling patterns and extracts data like usernames of the vendors, drugs offered for sale, shipping from country,
description of the products and acceptable payment options. These Drug selling markets use the combination of tools to ensure anonymity of participants
with the delivery of products by mail to enable the development of drug trafficking. Using data collected on these crawling methods this study provides an
overview of the Indian drug markets. It will help the Law Enforcement Agencies to inform about the most prevalent drugs vendors offer for sale and the selected
destination countries. It also gives an insight into the structure and organization of drug selling networks existing online. Diversification of vendors,
replication across marketplaces, number of listings managed by each vendor, drug markets numbers they are active and theproducts they offer for sale can
also be discovered. Analysis of data produced as outcome contains the knowledge on drug selling activities. Moreover, darknet markets selling drugs were
difficult to analyze based only on digital data. It should rely on a combination of physical data within a single model to produce an effective outcome.
